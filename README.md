# CardieFlash
## What?
CardieFlash is a flexible flashcard app. It currently uses SQLite but changing databases is easy as long as they are SQL based.

## Why?
I wasn't happy with other flashcard apps on the market, this app is supposed to be flexible, portable, lightweight and easy to use.
Also I'm interested in learning patterns, I'm planning to analyze the generated results to create and test new algorithms. Flashcards
are perfectly fit for determining these patterns because answer correctness can be determined easily. As a beginner I plan to use
this project to force me into different methods and concepts I wouldn't know otherwise. 

## Goals
* Creating a FOSS flashcard app that will:
  - Work on multiple platforms
  - Allow multiple users and interaction between these users. (Stats, Deck/Card Sharing and creating communities)
  - Have an easy installation and/or hosting process
  - Allow people to see their own statistics and progress and alter algorithms
  - Offer an easy way to import/export their data
  - Will determine how user's learn and change algorithms depending on user's success

These are the long term goals I have set for myself. Development itself will follow series of short term goals. 

## Current status
My current goal is to finish all SQL related implementation to start wroking on the GUI.
